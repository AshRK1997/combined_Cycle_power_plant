# Combined cycle power plant

Creating the best model I can for the Combined Cycle Power plant dataset present in UCI repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Combined+Cycle+Power+Plant).

Checked various regression models on this dataset from Linear Regression to Support Vector Regression. Found that Random Tree Classifier has made the highest accuracy score (sklearn library) of 96.5%.
